// This file is written in ES5 since it's not transpiled by Babel.
// This file does the following:
// 1. Sets Node environment variable
// 2. Registers babel for transpiling our code for testing  => replaced with mocha --compilers option
// 3. Disables Webpack-specific features that Mocha doesn't understand.
// 4. Requires jsdom so we can test via an in-memory DOM in Node
// 5. Sets up global vars that mimic a browser.

 hot module reloading code) doesn't apply for tests. then why not set to 'production' ?

 But also, we don't want to set it to production here for
 two reasons:
 1. You won't see any PropType validation warnings when
 code is running in prod mode.
 2. Tests will not display detailed error messages
 when running against production version code
